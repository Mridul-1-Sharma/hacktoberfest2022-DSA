**1. What is data structure?**
   - Data structure is a way of defining, storing & retrieving data in a structural & systematic way. A data structure may contain different types of data items.

**2. What are various data structures available?**
   - Data structure availability may vary by programming language. Commonly available data structures are lists, arrays, stacks, queues, graphs, trees, etc.

**3. What is an algorithm?**
   - An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in certain order to get the desired output.

**4. Why do we need to do algorithm analysis?**
   - A problem can be solved in more than one way. So, many solution algorithms can be derived for a given problem. We analyze available algorithms to find and implement the best suitable algorithm.

**5. What are the criteria for algorithm analysis?**
   - An algorithm is generally analyzed on two factors − time and space. That is, how much execution time and how much extra space is required by the algorithm

**6. What is an asymptotic analysis of an algorithm?**
   - Asymptotic analysis of an algorithm refers to defining the mathematical foundation/framing of its run-time performance. Using asymptotic analysis, we can very well conclude the best case, average case and worst case scenario of an algorithm.

**7. What are asymptotic notations?**
   - Asymptotic analysis can provide three levels of mathematical binding of the execution time of an algorithm:
      - The best case is represented by Ω(n) notation.
      - The worst case is represented by Ο(n) notation.
      - The average case is represented by Θ(n) notation.

**8. What is linear data structure?**
   - A linear data structure has sequentially arranged data items. The next time can be located in the next memory address. It is stored and accessed in a sequential manner. Array and list are examples of linear data structures.

**9. What are common operations that can be performed on a data structure?**
   - The following operations are commonly performed on any data structure:
     - Insertion − adding a data item
     - Deletion − removing a data item
     - Traversal − accessing and/or printing all data items
     - Searching − finding a particular data item
     - Sorting − arranging data items in a pre-defined sequence

**10. Briefly explain the approaches to developing algorithms.**
   - There are three commonly used approaches to developing algorithms:
      - Greedy Approach − finding a solution by choosing the next best option 
      - Divide and Conquer − diving the problem to the minimum possible sub-problem and solving them independently 
      - Dynamic Programming − diving the problem to a minimum possible sub-problem and solving them combinedly
